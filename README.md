# Sensor-Based-PM-Exposure-Monitoring-
This repository contains R scripts and sample outputs from my ongoing work at WRI India. The focus is on monitoring and analyzing PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ exposure using low-cost sensors and high-resolution DustTrak data.

🔬 Key Features

Time-series trend analysis of PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀

Integration of sensor and DustTrak data for spatial exposure pattern analysis

Categorization by weekday/weekend and peak/lean hours to understand the variation of pollution during different times and urban settings

🛠 Tools & Libraries

R (tidyverse, lubridate, openair, ggplot2)

QGIS for spatial overlays

Data collected via mobile and stationary platforms in Agra and Mumbai

📊 Sample Outputs

🔐 **Notes**

All sample data in the /data folder has been anonymized or simulated for sharing purposes.
